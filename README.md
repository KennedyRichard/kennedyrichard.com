# Script and content for generating static website for https://kennedyrichard.com

Just execute the generate.py script like this in this folder:

```
python3 generate.py
```

Depending on your system, you might have to replace `python3` by `python`.

It will read contents from the `content` folder and create a new sibling `output` folder with the generated website. If the `output` folder already exists at the time of the call, it is removed completely and then generated.

It relies solely on Python and its standard library.

Once you are satisfied with the changes and commit them, you can execute...

```
python3 addhash.py
```

And it will add the hash code generated by `git rev-parse HEAD` at the end of the website's footer.
